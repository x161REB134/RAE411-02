# # For this assignment there is two HTML files uploaded. 
## Nr.1 is HTML file trying to connect to the web page and receive the JSON data from it. It is not successful, since it is giving back error "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://4v9r83qfo4.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing)". During online research this error corresponds to : site does not send data to requesters. Solution would be the enabling CORS on the data page. 

## Nr.2 is HTML file with data manually copied into the file and then worked with it. Pressing button "Click me" will show the data in a sentence. HTML was used for shoving content, but JavaScript for working with JSON data and creating sentence (output)

## My goal at the beginning was to merge these two HTML files. By clicking "Click me" button, JavaScript would receive the data from WEB page and then create sentence which would be displayed.
